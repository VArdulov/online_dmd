[Dynamic Mode Decomposition](https://hal-polytechnique.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01020654/document) is a powerful data processing tool that allows for dynamical systems modeling by using a numerical and computational approximation of the Koopman Opertator. This library implements import improvements in the use of these algorithms for real time dynamical system adaptation as presented in [Zhang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02876).

Please note I hold no affiliations to any of the authors above, this is simply my interpretation and implementation of the algorithms presented in their works.
